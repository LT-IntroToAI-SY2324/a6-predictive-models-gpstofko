# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value is how correlated the data to the best fit line, and how close the data points are to the line. A r squared value closer to 1 means the data fit the linear regression model closely while a r squared value of <0.5 means the data does not fit the linear regression model well.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
The predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years is 137.46.
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
The models predictions are somewhat accurate, there is a relatively high r squared value for the data and the linear regression model meaning it can make alright predictions, but they shouldn't be heavily relied on. If the model was a different regression that fits the data more closely with a high r squared value then the models' predictions would be better.
